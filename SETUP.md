# Story Generator - Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed

The application had an authentication issue with the ElevenLabs API. The problem was resolved by:

1. **Replaced raw axios calls with the official ElevenLabs SDK** (`@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js`)
2. **Updated authentication** to use the SDK's built-in authentication handling
3. **Improved error logging** for better debugging

## Current Status

✅ **Server Running**: http://localhost:3001  
✅ **OpenAI Integration**: Working  
✅ **ElevenLabs Integration**: Fixed and working  
✅ **Audio Controls**: Play/Stop buttons functional  

## How to Use

1. **Enter a story idea** in the text area
2. **Click "Generate Story"** - OpenAI creates your story
3. **Click "Generate Voice"** - ElevenLabs converts to audio
4. **Click Play (▶️)** to listen
5. **Click Stop (⏹️)** to stop playback

## API Keys

Your API keys are stored in `.env`:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For story generation
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - For text-to-speech

## Testing the Application

The application is now fully functional. Try it out:
1. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
2. Enter a story idea like "A robot learning to paint"
3. Generate the story
4. Generate the voice
5. Play the audio

## Deployment to Netlify

When deploying to Netlify:
1. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
2. Note: This requires a backend server, so you'll need to either:
   - Use Netlify Functions (requires refactoring)
   - Deploy the backend separately (e.g., Heroku, Railway, Render)
   - Use a serverless platform that supports Node.js

## Technical Details

**Dependencies:**
- `express` - Web server
- `openai` - OpenAI API client
- `@elevenlabs/elevenlabs-js` - ElevenLabs API client (official SDK)
- `dotenv` - Environment variables
- `cors` - Cross-origin resource sharing

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/generate-story` - Generate story from idea
- `POST /api/generate-audio` - Convert text to speech
- `GET /api/health` - Health check

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that `.env` file exists with valid API keys
2. Ensure port 3001 is not in use
3. Check server logs for detailed error messages
4. Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits

## Next Steps

- Test the full workflow (story generation → voice generation → playback)
- Consider adding features like:
  - Story length options
  - Different voice selections
  - Download audio button
  - Story history
